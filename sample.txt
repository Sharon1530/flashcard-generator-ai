Photosynthesis is a process used by plants to convert light energy into chemical energy.
Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and uses it to transform carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.
This process primarily occurs in the leaves of plants within specialized cell structures called chloroplasts.
